            <p id="introduction">Question or dare is a game you can play with friends or family and spend a good  time together. First of all, each player will have to enter their names. Once the name submitted, the player will have to choose between one of the two cards on the screen. Once the card chosen, the player will either have to answer a question or do an action. For each right answers, the player earns 1 point, and for 3 right answers in a row, the player will be given the chance to either add or remove a point to any of the other players. However, no point is given for actions. At the end, the player with most points wins the game. </p>
